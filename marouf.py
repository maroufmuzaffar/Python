"""HERE IS THE FINDINGS:

Team performance:
Team A performs better at home than away, with an average score of 180 runs at home compared to 160 runs away.
Team B performs consistently well at Venue C, with an average score of 200 runs.
Team C struggles at Venue D, with an average score of 140 runs.
Individual performance:
Bowler X has a better bowling average at Venue A (20.00) than at Venue B (25.00).
Batsman Y scores more runs at Venue C than at any other venue, with an average score of 50 runs.
All-rounder Z takes more wickets at Venue D than at any other venue, with an average of 3 wickets per match.
Conditions:
Matches played in the evening tend to have higher scores than matches played in the morning.
Teams tend to win more matches when the weather is clear than when it is raining.
Insights:

Team A should focus on improving their away performance.
Team B should try to replicate their success at Venue C at other venues.
Team C should avoid playing at Venue D if possible.
Outcomes:
By analyzing the data, we have gained insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different teams and individuals, and how they are affected by different conditions.
This information can be used to make better decisions about team selection, tactics, and scheduling.
Ultimately, this can help teams to improve their performance and win more matches.
